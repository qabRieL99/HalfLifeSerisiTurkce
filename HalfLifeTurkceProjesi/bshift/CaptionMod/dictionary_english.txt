Once the process has started, you'll also need to release the dampen locks each time the system has charged in order to open the displacement field. Don't worry, Mr. Calhoun, the process is simple, and I'll let you know when you need to do something."
"ro_tele_final03"	"What are you waiting for, Calhoun? Get up to the control room, and locate the main power switch."
"ro_tele_final04"	"Please hurry, Mr. Calhoun! We don't have much time!"
"ro_tele_final05"	"Very good. Stand by, Calhoun. Once the system initialized, it will take few moments for the interpolating resonance coils to archive focus."
"ro_tele_final06"	"Everything is looking nom... Oh no, the primary cooling line has been raptured. Calhoun, go to the valve located on the catwalk, and release the pressure! Hurry, before the system overheats!"
"ro_tele_final07"	"This is no time for games, Calhoun! If the secondary cooling pipe bursts the machine will explode. You must crank the valve on the catwalk now!"
"ro_tele_final08"	"Good. Now, keep turning the crank, until the pressure level reaches normal."
"ro_tele_final09"	"Don't let the pressure reach critical, Calhoun! You must continue cranking until the level reaches nominal!"
"ro_tele_final10"	"Good work, Calhoun. That was close. The system has been stabilized, and main capacitors are charging. When main charger meter reaches full, I'll need you to open the displacement field from the control room."
"ro_tele_final11"	"Simmons, can you hear me? Get the rest of the team together, and prepare to teleport. Remember, we can only send one person at a time, so be patient."
"ro_tele_final12"	"Wait for it, Calhoun! You can't open the displacement field until the charger reaches its maximum."
"ro_tele_final13"	"I told you to wait until the system is fully charged! Be patient, Calhoun!"
"ro_tele_final14"	"Okay, the system is fully charged. Throw the switch located at the window of the control room!"
"ro_tele_final15"	"Go ahead, Calhoun. Throw the displacement field switch. What are you waiting for?"
"ro_tele_final16"	"Calhoun, our time is running out! Go to the window of the control room, and throw the switch."
"ro_tele_final17"	"It's too late, the system is collapsing! You've killed us all, Calhoun!"
"ro_tele_final18"	"Very good, Calhoun. I'll begin charging the system for the next teleport event."
"ro_tele_final19"	"Almost there. All right, we've reached full charge again. Open the field, Calhoun!"
"ro_tele_final20"	"Excellent. The next jump can go through now."
"ro_tele_final21"	"Let's keep going. The main capacitors are charging."
"ro_tele_final22"	"Okay, it's ready. Throw the switch again!"
"ro_tele_final23"	"You must go now, Simmons!"
"ro_tele_final24"	"Oh no!	"
"ro_tele_final25"	"I'm going to go through next, but don't worry, Mr. Calhoun. I've set the system to automatically start the charging sequence once I've made it through. Just wait for the levels to reach full again, and open the field like you've been doing."
"ro_tele_final26"	"All right, it's ready."
"ro_tele_final27"	"Good luck, Mr. Calhoun. I'll see you on other side!"
"ro_tele_final28"	"There, the field is open. Go now, Walter!"
"ro_tele_nocell"	"I'm glad to see you're all right, Mr. Calhoun, but we really need another power cell if we expect to get out of here. You'll have to go back down there, find a power cell, and send it back up to us fully charged. We're all depending on you."
"ro_tele_power1"	"Good job, Mr. Calhoun. We begin to worry when you didn't come back for some time, but it looks though you were able to get the device operational. The signal we're getting is very strong, but I'm afraid I have some bad news. The power reservoirs were just enough to open a field for your trip to the borderworld. If we plan on keeping the teleporter open long enough to calculate a safe exit point, and allow time for everyone to go through, someone will have to go to the lower level, and retrieve another power cell."
"ro_tele_power2"	"A few of our colleagues went down there while ago, but we haven't heard them from since. I can only fear for the worst."
"ro_tele_power3"	"I hate to keep putting you in this position, but you must realize that if someone doesn't go down there, then no one us will get out of here alive. Besides, you're the best equipped to deal with any dangers that may be waiting. Here, I'll show you to the access elevator that leads to the power generator. Follow me."
"ro_tele_power4"	"Calhoun! Where are you? We need you to go down below, and find us another power cell!"
"ro_tele_power5"	"Ah, here we are. Down below, the old power generators that we used to service this lab. You should find what we're looking for down there. Once you locate a new power cell, make sure it's charged, and send it up to the freight lift. Good luck."
"ro_tele_xen01"	"Excellent, Walter. Finish aligning the power cell matrix, and I'll see if I can get the system online in the main room. Now, there's no time to waste."
"ro_tele_xen02"	"Well, looks like the equipment is in better shape than expected."
"ro_tele_xen03a"	"Unfortunately, this older technology does not have the ability to target an Earth destination in its current state. You see, Mr. Calhoun, teleportation isn't as easy as going from point A to point B. We've discovered a strange borderworld that was somehow involved in the process which kept us from accurately predicting where any given teleportation event would lead to back on Earth."
"ro_tele_xen03b"	"Some of the more promising research on the matter led to a device that could be attached to strange crystalline structures we found on this borderworld. Now, this device, could then be used as a focal point and relay to aid in the teleportation. Well, in theory that is."
"ro_tele_xen04"	"We lost contact with the survey group shortly after the device was in place. We later discovered other methods of aiming the field, but all the equipment in this lab uses the older technology. In order for any of us to get out of here alive, someone will have to go to the borderworld, and activate the device."
"ro_tele_xen05"	"I'm afraid you're the only one who can do this. Seeing as how everyone else will be needed to operate the equipment."
"ro_tele_xen06"	"We should be able to get you fairly close to where the survey team had setup, but I fear the likelihood of running into alien creatures is very high. Once you find the device, simply power it on, and line the emitters until the signal reaches maximum strength. We'll reopen the teleport for your return, once we receive the signal, but you must hurry back. As we can keep it open for a short amount of time."
"ro_tele_xen07"	"All right. I'm going to initiate the teleporting charging sequence now. Be ready Mr. Calhoun. Once the field is open, it will become unstable very quickly."
"ro_tele_xen08"	"The primary capacitors have reached fully charge. Simmons! Release the dampen locks, and open the field."
"ro_tele_xen09"	"The field, it's open! Calhoun, enter to the teleporter!"
"ro_tele_xen10"	"You must make the jump now, Calhoun. The displacement field can't sustain itself much longer."
"ro_tele_xen11"	"You fool, you've taken too long! The impulse reflection rotors are burning up. I can't shut it down. Run!"
"ro_tele_xen12"	"Simmons, can you hear me? It's ready."
"ro_to_teleport"	"We should've choosen the Lambda Reactor for an escape, but the crew there is bent on fighting the creatures, with all their hopes set on someone named Freeman. Let those fools try and fight a battle they can't win. I just want to get out of here."
"ro_too_slow"	"You fool, you taken too long!"
"ro_wait0"	"Don't leave me here, Calhoun. We need to stick together."
"ro_wait1"	"This is no time to rest. We must keep going."
"ro_wait2"	"I'll wait here."
"ro_wait3"	"I'll stay here, but hurry back."
"ro_wait4"	"Yes, maybe you should go on ahead for a bit. Just don't forget about me."
"ro_wait5"	"I may be slowing you down, but you'll need me to get in to the lab."
"ro_wait6"	"We have no time to take a break. We must keep going."
"ro_wait7"	"Please don't leave me here, Calhoun. I'll be defenseless if those soldiers find me."
"ro_wound0"	"I seem to be wounded, but I can keep going."
"ro_wound1"	"I'm not doing too well, but I can make it."
"ro_xen_call1"	"Calhoun, you must hurry! We can't keep the portal open much longer!"
"ro_xen_call2"	"If you can hear me Calhoun, you must hurry! The teleporter charge is running out!"
"ro_xen_call3"	"It's too late, the field is collapsing. Calhoun!"
"ro_yard_access1"	"Yes, here it is. We'll need to break through this to get to the elevator."
"ro_yard_access2"	"I see you already found the elevator. Let's hurry then."
"ro_yard_almost2"	"Follow me."
"ro_yard_almost3"	"Let's stick together. We're almost there."
"ro_yard_follow1"	"Follow me."
"ro_yard_follow2"	"Calhoun. Follow me."
"ro_yard_hurry02"	"Please hurry, Mr. Calhoun."
"ro_yard_notime"	"Now, there's no time to waste."
"ro_yard_rose1"	"Yes, I'm Dr. Rosenberg. Although I'm not very proud to admit it, seen as though I'm partially responsible for all of this."
"ro_yard_rose2"	"How did you know my name? Oh I see, poor Harold.\nYes, our plan was to get to one of the the old prototype labs. It involved something that very few people in the facility authorized to know about. The same technology that brought about this catastrophe could also be our only way out. You see, I was involved in the very early work on teleporter technology. Long before the Lambda Complex was even built. There may be enough equipment in the old lab to piece together a device that would allow us to teleport outside out of the facility. As improbable as that might sound to someone like yourself. Of course, none of that does us a whole lot of good while we're stuck in here."
"ro_yard_rose3"	"Hmm. Perhaps I could help boost you through that vent in the ceiling. If you're lucky, you might be able to take those soldiers by surprise."
"ro_yard_rose4"	"All right. Now, we'll need head back to area where you met Harold. The access to the old lab should still be there, but we may have to break through some of the newer construction to get through it."
"ro_yard_scanner"	"Well, I hope the old security system is still active. With any luck my fingerprint ID is still valid and on file."

"tr_holo_duck"	"You'll need to duck under the next set of obstacles. When you crawl in a crouch position, you can move very silently. This can be very useful when you don't want to be heard."
"tr_holo_jduck"	"Now, try combining moves. You'll need to jump, duck, and then jump again. This should get you prepared for the next room where you'll have to do both moves at the same time."
"tr_holo_pipeduck"	"To get into the these pipes, you'll need to perform a duck jump. You'll wanna stand right at the mouth of the pipe. While moving forward, jump up and hold the jump button to go into a crouch in midair. It may be tricky at first, but you'll find it comes in handy to be able to jump and duck into tight areas."
