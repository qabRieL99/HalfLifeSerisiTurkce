<td>Good morning, doctor. Doctor. Looks like you two are right on time today. I'm afraid there's been some trouble with the system, so you may have been deleted from the security database. If you follow me to the door, I can get you inside where you can straighten it all out. So I guess today is the big day, huh? The big guy was pretty excited when he came in earlier. He was talking about the new guy, Dr. Freeman. I just hope everything goes well today. All right, this should only take a second.</td>
<td>Günaydın, doktor. Doktor. Görünüşe bakılırsa ikiniz bugün tam vaktinde geldiniz. Korkarım sistemle ilgili bir sorun çıktı, bu yüzden ikiniz de güvenlik veritabanından silinmiş olabilirsiniz. Beni kapıya kadar takip ederseniz, hepsini çözebileceğiniz yere götürebilirim. Demek büyük gün bugün, ha? Patron bugün geldiğinde bayağı heyecanlıydı. Yeni eleman hakkında konuşuyordu, Dr. Freeman'ın. Umarım bugün her şey yolunda gider. Peki, bu sadece birkaç saniye sürecek.</td>

<td>Good morning. They're waiting for you in the control room. Oh, I'll get the door for you. They should be able to get you back into the security database in the next room.</td>
<td>Günaydın. Sizi denetim odasında bekliyorlar. Oh, kapıyı sizin için açayım. Sizi bir sonraki odada güvenlik sistemine geri alabileceklerdir.</td>

<td>Greetings! It looks as though your data was lost in the system failure this morning. Not to worry, I can re-register you at this station. Step into the booth one at a time and I'll start the procedure. Please be still during the procedure. Don't worry, Doctor Cross, it should only take a few moments. Please don't move while I scan for re-registration into the security database. It will be over before you know it, Doctor Green.</td>
<td>Merhabalar! Görünüşe göre bugünkü sistem çöküntüsünde sizin verilerinizde kayıp yaşanmış. Endişelenecek bir şey yok, sizi bu istasyonada tekrar kayıt edebilirim. Kabine tek tek girin ve işlemi başlatayım. Lütfen işlem sırasında sabit durun. Merak etmeyin, Doktor Cross, birkaç saniyenizi alacak. Lütfen ben güvenlik veritabanına tekrar kayıt etmek için tararken hareket etmeyin. Farkına varmadan bitiverecek, Doktor Green.</td>

<td>There you go. See you after the experiment.</td>
<td>Oldu işte. Deneyden sonra görüşürüz.</td>

<tr>
<td>Ah, hello Doctors. It's nice to see someone is on time today. Doctor Freeman is running late, again. Honestly, I do not understand what Kleiner sees in that boy. Anyway, let's get started. When Dr. Freeman is running upstairs, they'll want to begin the experiment, so you'll need to retrieve the sample, Dr. Cross, and I'll let Dr. Green into the test chamber to make other preparations. Ah, hello, Dr. Rosenberg. We're sort of in the middle of something right now, so if you could...</td>

<tr>
<td>I've been talking to Harold. He seems to be under the impression that you're planning on running the anti-mass spectrometer at greater than ninety percent. You realize there is a reason for the safety buffer.</td>

<tr>
<td>I understand your concern, doctor, but the administrator was quite clear.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The administrator is a bureaucrat, not a scientist. I did not design this equipment to be run at such high intensity.</td>

<tr>
<td>This is not your decision. Now, if you wish to stay and monitor the experiment, so be it. Otherwise, you can go back to your little labs over by the train yard.</td>
<td></td>

<tr>
<td>Doctor Cross, the sample storage area is through the door here, and Doctor Green, we need you in the test chamber. We'll monitor the experiment from here.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>If you would be so kind as to push the sample into the lift, we can start the experiment.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interesting. That shouldn't happen. You know, theoretically, this is impossible. Hmm, right. Something must be jammed. See if there's anything interfering with the lift machinery in the test chamber below. I'll continue trying to operate the lift from here.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ah, excellent. Everything appears to be on schedule, and the experiment will be starting shortly. I will leave the loudspeaker on so you can hear what's happening upstairs. Power to stage one emitters in three... two... one... I'm seeing predictable phase arrays. Stage two emitters activating...now. Gordon, we cannot predict how long the system can operate at this level, nor how long the reading will take. Please work as quickly as you can. Overhead capacitors to one oh five percent. Uh...it's probably not a problem...probably...but I'm showing a small discrepancy in... Well, no, it's well within acceptable bounds again. Sustaining sequence. I have just been informed that the sample is ready, Gordon. It should be coming up to you any moment now. Look to the delivery system for your specimen. Shutting down. Attempting shut down. It's not...it's-it's not...it's not shutting down...it's not...</td>

<tr>
<td>The dampening fields failed!</td>

<tr>
<td>The dampening fields are designed not to fail. The only way this could have happened is if someone turned them off, and even then there should have been a noticeable discrepancy in the displacement flow indicators.</td>
<td></td>

<tr>
<td>They failed! The entire containment system has collapsed! This is a resonance cascade, Doctor Rosenberg.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yes, you're right. Well, we've got to get everyone out of here. Reach the surface, call for help, something!</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No! We've got to deal with the problem. We can't expect anyone else to understand the importance of resetting those dampening fields. Without them in place, the dimensional gash could tear so wide it may never be repaired.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It's too dangerous. If we fail, who will warn everyone else? We can have soldiers here in two hours who can secure the facility and bring everyone to safety. Our concern must be with the people of Black Mesa.</td>
<td></td>

<tr>
<td>Perhaps you're right. Doctor Cross and Doctor Green may have survived. If so, they can help us. I'll try to find them with this terminal.</td>

<tr>
<td>No, don't touch that!</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oh, thank goodness you've survived. Those HEV suits of yours are well designed, Dr. Cross.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Doctors, we have formulated a plan. You must escort Rosenberg to the surface, help him call for help. I couldn't possibly make it in my chair. I'll stay behind and assess the damage to our equipment and the extent of the cascade. Maybe I can find a clue as to what went wrong and how we can right things.</td>

<tr>
<td>I don't like the idea of leaving you here, but it seems we have no choice.</td>

<tr>
<td>Let me activate the service lift. There's a shortcut through the training area that will get you to the surface. Good luck.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All right. Let's go.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Despite what Dr. Keller believes, our only concern now should be for the people trapped inside Black Mesa. We need to get to the surface to reach the satellite communication equipment. Once they know what's going on, I'm confident they'll immediately send the military in to rescue us. There's an elevator nearby that will take us up to where we need to go. Follow me. Damn, it seems the elevator controls aren't functioning. There is a maintenance area below us. I think, perhaps, you can get the elevator working from down there. You'll have to make your way through the hazard course to reach the maintenance area. I know I don't have to remind you that your hazard suit will protect you, but I'll think I'll be safer if I wait here.</td>

<tr>
<td>Hmm, I should be able to open this door.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>We made it! Now at the end of this tunnel is an access shaft that leads right to the surface. From there we'll be able to reach the satellite communications center and call for help. Good work, I couldn't have gotten here without you. Let's go.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Now that we've made it to the surface, we can get help. If we're quick enough, the people below may have a chance. Behind this fence is a satellite communications center we can use to communicate with military personnel outside of Black Mesa. The military has the best chance at being able to secure the facility and they'll be able to escort us to safety. Let's go.</td>

<tr>
<td>Inside is the control room for the satellite dish, but this door is locked. If you can find a way into that warehouse, you should be able to make your way around to the other side of this door to let me in. I'll wait here. The way is too dangerous for me, but you'll be protected by the hazard suits.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ah, you made it! The control room is just up the stairs. Quick, come with me.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>From here we'll be able to contact the military, but it appears the satellite dish is not aligned. One of you needs to go down and rotate the dish. The instruments in this room will tell us when the dish is positioned correctly.</td>

<tr>
<td>Dr. Keller? Dr. Keller? Do you read me? We've established the uplink and are transmitting the emergency signal.</td>

<tr>
<td>Good work, but there's no time to wait for the military. I need the team down here immediately! The dampening fields are going critical and must be reset.</td>

<tr>
<td>I understand. I'll send them down. Out.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Listen, I can wait here for the military to arrive, but you're needed to help with the situation down below or others will be put in peril. You've done your job here, now get below and reach Dr. Keller. Be careful, both of you. Hopefully I'll see you on the outside.</td>

<tr>
<td>Now, you'll have to reset the secondary locks first. Only the primary conduit is strong enough to support a full flow and I honestly can't guarantee it will hold. Let's see how the area is holding up. Ah, I can use this console to transmit directly to your suit's audio system. Let's try it out. Test. Testing. Excellent. I'll be able to communicate with you anywhere in the facility. Be wary, my friends. Resetting the locks will probably put quite a strain on the pressure release valves, and they may cause increased displacement activity.</td>

<tr>
<td>That emergency bulkhead won't open until the secondary dampening locks are reset.</td>

<td>I did it, the displacement fields have shut down. Damn it, this is the second time they've failed us! I'm going to see if I can access the transit system and bring a working tram to us. I'm afraid whatever held the rift open did so with intent, my friends. These aliens may not all be here by accident.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>The dimensional rift between here and the alien world must be sealed. We'll need to have the satellite in orbit in order to orchestrate a resonance reversal. The signal room for the satellite is nearby. Unfortunately, the delivery rocket cannot launch without the all-clear codes. Now any security guard in this dorm complex should have the codes we need. Go through the dorms and find a security guard. I'll take the tram around to the north side where we can pick you up. Good luck.</td>

<tr>
<td>Gina? Colette? Do you read me? You're in the basement of the Black Mesa air control building. You need to find the control room. Set the air space monitor to send the all-clear codes so that Lambda Labs can launch the delivery rocket and deploy the satellite. I can unlock the security door in front of you from here, but I'm afraid the other power lock doors offer no remote access. You'll have to unlock them from inside.</td>

<tr>
<td>You'll need to work quickly as we're running out of time. The beacon lift must be jammed because the surface seal won't open. Clear the obstruction and then use the controls to raise the beacon.</td>

<td>Up those stairs you can access the alien quarantine labs. I fear that the scientists working there may have been overcome by the very creatures they were studying. We need you to get inside those labs and activate a beam matrix which powers the displacement beacon. You won't find much help in activating the system, but I'm sure with your training it will be a simple matter.</td>

<tr>
<td>Great, you've done it! Get back to the elevator, both of you.</td>
<td></td>

<tr>
<td>Good work. With the beam matrix active, we can attempt a resonance reversal. We seem to have become quite an effective team, but everything comes down to this. The rift has become dangerously wide and it may already be too late. We must act, now!</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You've done well, but we're not done yet. You must use the displacement beacon's focus emitter to charge the large crystals on the canyon walls. Once charged, I'll use them to start the resonance reversal. Those crystals will be far more effective than the dampening fields.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When you start charging the crystals, the alien force will detect it and they'll try to stop you. It's possible you could be dealing with more enemies than you've ever seen. You must charge the crystals as quickly as possible.</td>

The beam capacitor is at fifty percent. Beam capacitor is now eighty percent. Ninety percent... Beam capacitor at one hundred percent, deploy the second crystal. Beam capacitor charged to twenty percent. Damnation! The security system has cut power to the bunker doors! There's no way we're getting in there now. Beam capacitor at seventy-five percent. One hundred percent, you can deploy the final crystal!</td>
