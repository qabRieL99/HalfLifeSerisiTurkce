![](https://i.imgur.com/BEAhVTU.jpg)

## Description
This mod includes 5 Half-Life games:
[Half-Life](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70), [Half-Life: Opposing Force](https://store.steampowered.com/app/50), [Half-Life: Blue Shift](https://store.steampowered.com/app/130), [Half-Life: Decay](https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-decay) and [Half-Life: Uplink](https://www.halflifeuplink.com/hlulsl).

## :information_source: General Notes
* It <ins>only works</ins> on the Steam version. (Current version is: `8684`)
* While playing the game with the mod, <ins>do not  join a online server.</ins>  Otherwise, you are likely to get a VAC ban.  It will not cause trouble in offline game (singleplayer mode).  If you still want to be on the safe side, start Steam in offline mode.
	* That's why you have to play Decay alone.
* Some lines in a few places could not be translated because they are hard-coded.
* In some cases, the texts were not used because they took up the screen.  (Grunts in Blue Shift, suit percentages in Decay)

## :clipboard: Installation
### :computer: Automatic:
1. Download the `CaptionMod Installer` app from the [Releases](https://github.com/qabRieL99/HalfLifeSerisiTurkce/releases/) section and run it.
2. The program will automatically find your Steam location and installed games.
3. Check the games you wish to install and press the `Install (YÃ¼kle)` button.
4. The mods will be installed and another program called CaptionMod Settings will be added to your desktop, with which you can make the necessary settings and start the games.

### :raised_hand: Manual:
1. Click [here](https://github.com/qabRieL99/HalfLifeSerisiTurkce/archive/v1.1.zip) to download all files.
2. Decide on the game you want to install:

|Abbreviation|Game|
|----|----|
|bshift|Half-Life: Blue Shift|
|decay|Half-Life: Decay|
|gearbox|Half-Life: Opposing Foce|
|hlulsl|Half-Life: Uplink|
|valve|Half-Life|

3. As an example, let's install Decay. Copy the `decay` folder in the downloaded file and put it in the Half-Life folder inside the Steam folder.  (By default, it's in `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life`)
4. Copy the application named `metahook` and put it in Half-Life folder and then rename it to `decay`.
5. Start the game from the application you named `decay`.

:star: After both types of installation, you have to delete `dictionary_english` file and rename the `decaying` to `dictionary_english` .

## :warning: General notes and tips about game and mod:
* Run the installer as an administrator to avoid problems during installation.
* If you are having trouble with the mouse in Blue Shift and Opposing Force, open the console and type `m_rawinput 1`.
	* You can also change the mouse sensitivity by typing `sensitivity #` in the console.  (Replace # with a number.)
* If you're having resolution issues, change the compatibility option in the app's properties. ([Picture](https://img.donanimhaber.com/upfiles/794792/66454e33-7d67-48fc-b0be-3520d8dc719e.jpeg))
	* If you are using a `16:9` resolution (such as `1920x1080` or `1366x768`), type `default_fov 106` in the console.
* Steam must be running to play the game.
