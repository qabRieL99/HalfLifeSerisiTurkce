I'm afraid you have been through a serious accident. Most of your friends didn't make it. I was hoping that you soldiers had come to rescue us, but now it seems we are all in the same situation. I think I saw a radio near the crash site where I found you. Perhaps you can go there and radio for help?"

As before, we were still only able to coerce the creature into latching onto organic materials. Unfortunately, the Administrator has called me down to the Anomalous Materials lab this morning for an important experiment, so I don't have any time to further my analysis. Take specimen number 1176 and log anything else you can find."

If you can make your way through the transit system, you can probably reach the surface where we are pulling out. Good luck! Over."
"of1a2_rd02"	"Get through the transit system to the extraction point. Don't-"

"of4a3_rd01"	"X-Ray Zulu, are you there? We need backup in the waste sector! It's some sort of worm creature. Tower and Eddy are down, and I've lost contact with the rest of the squad. We need backup now! Now, damn it, now!"
"of6A2_rd01"	"Adrian? Is that you? Listen, we're hold up across the mortar field, but we're pinned down by a group of Black Ops. We'll open the bunker door, but you better get over here quick."

"of6a4_ba03"	"It's not gonna be easy from here on out. The only way out is through the Level 4 Storage Unit, but it's a mess down there. The Black Ops were using it as a staging point until the aliens came in. If you do make it through, make sure you have them come back for us."
"of6a4_ba04"	"I guess you're a good guy, Corporal. Listen, you've got to get down below. There's something coming through and it's the nastiest looking thing yet. Some of your buddies went down there a while ago and I haven't seen them since. I've got some weapons I've piled up in here, you better take as much as you can carry, 'cause I think this is it.

"of1a6_fg02"	"Shephard, you've made it. I take it you didn't find Freeman? Forget it, Corporal. We are puling out. The air strike has started. Get to the hangar while we await evac."
"of1a6_fg03"	"I said get to the hangar, Shephard. That is an order."
"of1a6_fg04"	"Where's Freeman? We don't have time to mess around here."
"of1a6_fg05"	"I'm not lettin' you go until you talk."
"of2a1_fg01""You've got the get out of here. Listen to me, Shephard. Those things... they'll kill all of us."
"of2a4_fg01"	"Looks like somebody really screwed up, Corporal. Seems the brass bit off more than they could chew."
"of2a4_fg02"	"Yeah, well, forget about Freeman! We've got to save our own asses."
"of2a4_fg03"	"You with us, Corporal."
"of2a5_fg01"	"Shephard, what the hell were you doing down there? Listen, we need to get our asses down to the extraction point near Lambda sector. With any luck, we'll even get a shot at Freeman on our way out. Now, this transit system should take us there, but the door is sealed up pretty tight. Jeez, where's an engineer when you need one?"
"of2a5_fg02"	"Corporal, I don't think I'm gonna make it. I need a Medic... bad."
"of2a5_fg03"	"Don't worry, soldier. I'll have you fixed up in no time."
"of2a5_fg04"	"Thanks, doc."
"of2a6_fg01"	"Corporal, what the hell is going on here? Nobody told us about Black Operations in the mission briefing."
"of2a6_fg02"	"Yeah, I mean we're all on the same team, right? Right?"
"of2a6_fg03"	"Well, I'm not sure what their mission is, but we need to keep moving. There's gotta be a transit car somewhere on these tracks."
"of3a4_fg01"	"Don't go in there, Corporal. That... monster... wiped out my squad."
"of5a1_fg01"	"Hey, man, good to see ya. Wow, I can't believe you made it pass those masked freaks."
"of5a1_fg02"	"Those snipers have pinned us down here pretty good. We tried making a break for it, but they know we're here. They're just waitin' for their shots, and those bastards are patient."
"of5a1_fg03"	"Yeah, I'd love to turn the table on those guys. Get my hands on one of those rifles, show them a thing or two about patience."
"of5a1_fg04"	"Hey, with you here now we have the element of surprise on our site. They're not expecting three of us. Heh heh heh."
"of5a3_fg01"	"Shephard! Oh man. We thought you made evac already."
"of5a3_fg02"	"It's good to see you, sir. It's a real mess out there. I mean these... things are coming out of the damn walls. Ain't no way around them either. They just keep coming!"
"of5a3_fg03"	"We may just have enough fire power to push through now. At very least, we can give it our best shot."
"of5a3_fg04"	"I heard about some kind of big standoff at the dam up ahead. I say we make our break for it now. It ain't gonna get any better, that's for sure, and I bet they could use our help."
"of5a3_fg05"	"It's Shephard! Hey, stand back, and I'll cut it. We're gonna need your help."
"of6a1_fg01"	"Shephard! I don't know what those Black Ops are up to, but it doesn't involve getting us out of here alive. We've got no choice but to fight our way out!"

"rope07"	"I'm almost impressed, soldier! Meet me in the next section and let's see if I can shake you up a bit."
"secondroom01"	"Mounted on the wall below me, you will see a PCV. This is a Powered Combat Vest. Use it correctly, and I guarantee it will save your life. Your PCV is able to recharge from battery power, or it can interface and recharge with commercial, military, and HEV charging stations."
"secondroom02"	"What are you waiting for? Grab that PCV and get it fully charged! Trust me, maggot, you're gonna need it! I'll meet you in the next area to demonstrate some of your vest's capabilities."
"seventhroom01"	"Well, I'll be damned! You may just have what it takes to be a soldier. Now double time it over to the next portion of your training."
"sixthroom01"	"In addition to providing protection, your PCV has other capabilities. Once the light goes out, the door in front of you will open. Activate your night vision goggles to navigate this maze and exit on the other side. Now move like you've got a purpose!"
"squad01"	"All right, dirtbag, you've proven yourself a capable grunt! Now let's see if there's any leadership qualities in that sorry carcass of yours. To became an effective leader, you must familiarize yourself with the skill set of each soldier in your platoon."
"squad02"	"The first type of soldier you will meet is the Engineer. Engineers have a knack for getting you in and out of places that are otherwise inaccessible. Take charge and have him follow you to the sealed door."
"squad03"	"As you can see, this soldier may prove quite useful in the field. Once you've breached the room, proceed through the door and meet the next type of soldier."
"squad04"	"The Medic can be one of the most valued soldiers on the field. They have the ability to heal both you and your fellow squad members. To receive medical attention, simply hold down your use key and the Medic will apply first aid. Once the Medic has attended to your wounds, proceed to the next area to complete your training."
"squad05"	"Listen up, soldier! During the course of your missions, you may not be in direct contact with your squad. In these situations, you will need to utilize any available military radios. These radios can be used to call in reinforcements or gain vital military intelligence."
"squad06"	"Approach the radio and use it, soldier!"
"squad07"	"Congratulations, soldier! You're no longer a low life maggot! I'm proud to say you are a soldier! I'm sure you'll be a credit to your unit. Now report to duty, soldier!"
"thirdroom01"	"The armored vest that your military has provided you with will keep you alive. Step onto the mark and this will be demonstrated for you."
"thirdroom02"	"As you can see, you are not dead. Your PCV absorbed the damage at the cost of some of its power.  Keep your PCV charged and your chances of survival in the field are very high. Proceed to the next area."
"add01"	"You eyeballin' me, boy?"
"add02"	"Are you touchin' me, dirtbag?"
"add03"	"What is your major malfunction?"
"add04"	"It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum, and I'm all out of bubble gum!"
"add05"	"I eat concertina wire and piss napalm!"
"add06"	"God has a hard-on for Marines."
"add07"	"I eat Green Berets for breakfast!"
"add08"	"You had best get your head on straight, maggot!"
"add09"	"Soldier, you are all ate up!"
"add10"	"Son, I will break you down like an M16!"
"add11"	"I smell smoke! And where there's smoke, there's fire! You better move it, soldier!"
"add12"	"I will smoke you like a Cuban cigar!"
"add13"	"Drop and give me twenty, maggot!"
"add14"	"Get down and break them elbows!"
"add15"	"What's your first general order, dirtbag?"
"add16"	"Where you from, soldier? Texas! Holy cow! You know what comes from Texas, don't you?"
"add17"	"Can I be in charge around here? Well, thank you very much!"
"add18"	"You had better square yourself away, Marine!"
"add19"	"You better move like you've got a purpose!"
